# INSIGHTS — repo

Durable, surprising lessons that bite across modules — things that *looked
obvious and weren't*. Append-only. New entries are added by the
`engineering-insights` skill. Read this file before solving a non-obvious
bug or making a "looks obvious" decision that spans modules. Module-level
findings live in `<module>/INSIGHTS.md`.

Keep under ~200 entries; split per sub-domain if it grows past that.

## Tool & Library Notes

### `pnpm typecheck` aborts on `ERR_PNPM_IGNORED_BUILDS` before tsc runs
_2026-06-18_ · `repo-wide` (`server/`, `client/`)

On a fresh corepack-pnpm 11.8 boot, `pnpm typecheck` (and any `pnpm exec
…`) triggers an implicit dep-status check that exits non-zero with
`ERR_PNPM_IGNORED_BUILDS` because `cpu-features`, multiple `esbuild`
versions, `protobufjs`, and `ssh2` have postinstall scripts that aren't on
the approved list. tsc never executes; CI logs read like a typecheck
failure but aren't. Workaround used this session: `./node_modules/.bin/tsc
--noEmit` direct. Permanent fix: `pnpm approve-builds` for those packages
(commit the resulting `package.json` change), or set
`package-manager-strict=false` in `.npmrc`.

## Recurring Errors & Fixes

### Adding a required field to a shared Zod contract rots inline test fixtures in both packages
_2026-06-18_ · `server/src/vendor/shared/contracts/trace.ts` ↔ `client/src/vendor/shared/contracts/trace.ts` (paired vendored copies)

The dual-vendoring rule is in root `CLAUDE.md`, but the actual bite is
*test* fixtures: every `RunStats` / `RunSummary` / `PrMeta` literal in
tests is hand-written. When I made `RunStats.cost_usd` required
(`z.number().nullable()`) tsc broke `server/test/contracts.test.ts:160`
AND `client/.../RunTraceDrawer/RunTraceDrawer.test.tsx:10` independently
— and the client failure surfaces as a vitest assertion, not a typecheck.
There is no schema-driven factory. Before you extend a shared contract:
grep both packages for the closest existing key combo (e.g.
`duration_ms.*tokens_in` for RunStats, `agent_name.*findings_count` for
RunSummary), patch every literal, and run vitest on both before assuming
tsc-green = tests-green.
